        "The idea behind this dataset is an effort to utilize machine learning to complete tasks of sorting and organizing large collections of digital music - MP3 files. Some reasons to use machine learning in this way, to name a few, include:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "- Sorting large collections of digital music files into genre automatically\r\n",
        "- Identifying the sonic signatures of popular music in different genres\r\n",
        "- Cover song detection, i.e. what songs were produced by sampling other songs? and for given a cover song, identify what song was sampled\r\n",
        "- Recognize the instruments used in songs\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Commercial applications of MIR include:\r\n",
        "- Software that teach musical instrument playing, by converting digital music files into easy to play music chords. [`Example - Chordify`](https://chordify.net/ \"Chordify\")\r\n",
        "- Software to auto-tune music samples during music production. [`Example - Melodyne`](https://www.celemony.com/en/start \"Melodyne\")\r\n",

        "### **Useful Solution Links For Challenges Ecountered:**\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "1. _Read CSV file into Colab from Google Drive folder:_ Utilized the drive mount method in the Google-Colab package. [`Loading data into Colab from Google Drive`](https://towardsdatascience.com/3-ways-to-load-csv-files-into-colab-7c14fcbdcb92 \"CSV from Google Drive\")\r\n",
        "2. *Read CSV file with multi-row headers using `pandas.read_csv`:* First solved the multi row header challenge here [`Pandas DataFrame: Playing with CSV files`](https://towardsdatascience.com/pandas-dataframe-playing-with-csv-files-944225d19ff \"CSV Multi-Row Header\"), then tackled renaming rows and column that showed up as \"unnamed\" using the tips from [`Stack Overflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48059994/mark-empty-values-in-pandas-dataframe-multi-row-header \"Rename dataframe columns\"). A sample from the data developers showing what the proper csv file read should look like is seen in this [`screenshot example`](https://ibb.co/DtWXXqX \"screenshot\")\r\n",
        "3. *Force index of pandas dataframe to be the first column of the CSV file using `pandas.DataFrame.set_index`:* The first resource found for this problem was to use the [`Pandas Set Index`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html \"Pandas Set Index\"). Some more help from [`Stackoverflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38542419/could-pandas-use-column-as-index \"Stackoverflow Index\")\r\n",
        "4. _Hierarchical indexing of pandas dataframe:_ Resource found for this problem was to use the [`Pandas Hierarchical indexing`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html \"Pandas Hierarchical indexing\"). Ended up going with the suggestions from the class mentors - Vishal and Michael\r\n",
        "5. *Plotting latitude and longitude points on map:* [`Method 1 - Use Shape Files`](https://towardsdatascience.com/geopandas-101-plot-any-data-with-a-latitude-and-longitude-on-a-map-98e01944b972 \"GeoPandas 101\"), too static. [`Method 2 - Use Image File`](https://towardsdatascience.com/easy-steps-to-plot-geographic-data-on-a-map-python-11217859a2db \"Image as Map\") still too static. [`Method 3 - Interactive Folium Maps`](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/scientists-guide-to-plotting-data-in-python/plot-spatial-data/customize-vector-plots/interactive-leaflet-maps-in-python-folium/ \"Folium\") this is a good option, but there's more interactive options. [`Method 4 - Interactive IpyLeaflet Maps`](https://towardsdatascience.com/ipyleaflet-interactive-mapping-in-jupyter-notebook-994f19611e79 \"IpyLeaflet\") lots of functionality, slightly more complicated steps. [`Method 5 - Jupyter Blog - Interactive Maps`](https://blog.jupyter.org/interactive-gis-in-jupyter-with-ipyleaflet-52f9657fa7a \"Jupyter Blog IpyLeaflet\") This tutorial is the best seen so far, tried it, but Colab doesn't support IpyLeaflet. [`Method 6 - Geographic Data with Basemap`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/04.13-Geographic-Data-With-Basemap.ipynb?authuser=1#scrollTo=_Mgwp62zuJL2 \"Colab maps with mpl_toolkits\") this method looks promising, although the maps are not interactive, the tutorial is useful. [`Method 7 - Google Earth Engine`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-colab \"Google Earth Engine\") this one requires authentication from Google. [`Method 8 - Iteration with Folium`](https://github.com/collinreinking/longitude_latitude_dot_plots_in_python_with_folium \"Iterative Markers\"). This is a step by step easy to follow method. [`Bonus Method`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39401729/plot-latitude-longitude-points-from-dataframe-on-folium-map-ipython \"Bonus Solution\")\r\n",
        "6. *Count occurence of words in Pandas column:* [`Count Occurrence in Column`](https://www.marsja.se/pandas-count-occurrences-in-column-unique-values/#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20Count%20the,in%20the%20column%20%E2%80%9Ccondition%E2%80%9D. \".value_counts\")\r\n",
        "7. *Better control of Folium map boundary:* [`Solution: Set Folium figure first`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48789751/set-map-boundary-and-stop-endless-panning-in-a-loop-of-folium-map \"Stackoverflow Folium Size\")\r\n",
